#This file was inpired by the full example of using deeplenstronomy.


## We start at the top level with the DATASET section

DATASET:
    NAME: ExampleDataset # set a name, this value is only used if you request the h5 file format
    PARAMETERS:
        SIZE: 1000 # number of images in the full dataset, I'll keep it small for this example
        OUTDIR: ExampleDataset # will be created on your system if your request to save images
        seed: 100

## Next we'll specify the COSMOLOGY to use, I'll keep it simple a just use basic values

COSMOLOGY:
    PARAMETERS:
        H0: 74.0
        Om0: 0.3


## the SPECIES section
## difering to the original full example I shall work with galaxy-galaxy lens system only
